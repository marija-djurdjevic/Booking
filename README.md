# Booking Application
## Overview
This is a desktop application designed to facilitate property bookings and guided tours. The project was developed as part of two university courses:

+ Software Specification and Modeling – Focused on writing maintainable and clean code while following software engineering principles.

+ Human-Computer Interaction – Focused on adapting the application to the specific needs of different user types.

The application supports four user roles:

+ Property Owner – Registers and manages accommodations.

+ Guest – Searches for and books accommodations.

+ Guide – Organizes guided tours.

+ Tourist – Participates in guided tours.

The project was developed by a team of four, with each member responsible for implementing one of these roles.

## My Contributions
As the developer responsible for the Owner role, I implemented key functionalities tailored to property owners, ensuring both usability and adherence to clean coding principles. My contributions include:

+ User-friendly reminders – Since my assigned persona was a user who frequently forgets information, I implemented reminder features to help them track their actions and essential details.

+ Personalization options –

  + Localization support for Serbian and English.

  + Theme selection to enhance the user experience.

+ Statistical insights –

  + Visualizations showing occupancy trends over months and years.

  + Identifying peak booking periods.
+ Recommendation system –

  + Analyzes the most popular locations in the application and suggests property owners open accommodations there.

  + Identifies areas with low demand and recommends closing accommodations in those locations.

+ PDF report generation – Exporting reports with guest numbers, reservation details, and key insights.

## Software Specification & Modeling
As part of the Software Specification and Modeling course, we created various diagrams to illustrate system behavior and structure, including:

+ Sequence Diagrams

+ Class Diagrams

+ Use Case Analysis

Below is an example of a sequence diagram:
